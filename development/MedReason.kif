; Medications


; A patient with persistent diarrhea has an infection and needs antibiotics

if the patient has an infection and an antibiotic is administered, then the patient will not have an infection (way oversimplified)

; TranexamicAcid

If a patient has low blood pressure, and catastrophic loss of blood (more than 50%), administer transexamic acid

; BloodProducts

A patient who has lost 20-50% of their blood requires a transfusion [whole blood] (or may die).
