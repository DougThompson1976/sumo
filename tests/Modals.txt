; 2.  Mary knows that Bill likes Sue and Bob likes Joan.  Does Mary know that Bill likes Sue.  (we did this one already).  Does Bill like Sue?

(knows Mary (and (likes Bill Sue) (likes Bob Joan)))

; query: (knows Mary (likes Bill Sue))  - yes
; query: (likes Bill Sue) - yes
; but if we change knows to believes then believing something doesn't make it true so the second query is unknown, see next one

; Some analysis with respect to the survey done at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic

; basic axioms - do these hold?

(=>
  (and
    (believes ?A ?F1)
    (believes ?A ?F2))
  (believes ?A
    (and ?F1 ?F2)))

(=>
  (or
    (believes ?A ?F1)
    (believes ?A ?F2))
  (believes ?A
    (or ?F1 ?F2)))

; especially, does this hold?

(=>
  (and
    (believes ?A ?F1)
    (=> ?F1 ?F2))
  (believes ?A ?F2))

; We have already in SUMO -

(<=>
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Necessity)
  (not
    (modalAttribute
      (not ?FORMULA) Possibility)))

; axiom 'D' is already in SUMO

(=>
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Necessity)
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Possibility))

;  We need the following basic axiom

(<=>
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Possibility)
  (not
    (modalAttribute
      (not ?FORMULA) Necessity)))

; need De Morgan's laws?

;       "It is not necessary that X" is logically equivalent to "It is possible that not X".

(<=>
  (not
    (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Necessity))
  (modalAttribute (not ?FORMULA) Possibility))

;        "It is not possible that X" is logically equivalent to "It is necessary that not X".

(<=>
  (not
    (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Possibility))
  (modalAttribute (not ?FORMULA) Necessity))

; 'N', the necessitation rule

(=>
  ?F
  (modalAttribute ?F Necessity))

; 'K' the distribution axiom
; this with 'N' is the most basic modal logic

(=>
  (modalAttribute
    (=> ?P ?Q)
    Necessity)
  (=>
    (modalAttribute ?P Necessity)
    (modalAttribute ?Q Necessity)))

; 'T' - reflexivity

(=>
  (modalAttribute ?P Necessity)
  ?P)

; axiom '4'

(=>
  (modalAttribute ?P Necessity)
  (modalAttribute
    (modalAttribute ?P Necessity)
    Necessity))

; axiom 'B'

(=>
  ?P
  (modalAttribute
    (modalAttribute ?P Possibility)
      Necessity))

; axiom 'D' is already in SUMO

(=>
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Necessity)
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Possibility))

; axiom '5' is really axiom N

(=>
  (modalAttribute ?F Possibility)
  (modalAttribute
    (modalAttribute ?F Possibility)
    Necessity))

; 'K' in epistemic

; 'K' the distribution axiom
; this with 'N' is the most basic modal logic

(=>
  (knows ?A
    (=> ?P ?Q))
  (=>
    (knows ?A ?P)
    (knows ?A ?Q)))

; axiom '4'

(=>
  (knows ?A ?P)
  (knows ?A
    (knows ?A ?P)))

; axiom 'K' makes sense - if I know that P implies Q then if I know P I also know Q

; note that many of the modal axioms don't make sense for deontic logic
; 'knows' and 'believes' don't map exactly to necessity and possibility
; for example, necessarily P implies P  and   knows P implies P (at least in SUMO) (axiom 'T')
; but while P implies necessarily P, P doesn't imply knows P (axiom 'N')
; so T, K, 4 are good but not N
; if we add 'believes' as the analogue to possibility:
; B doesn't make sense.  If P is true that doesn't mean one knows that one believes P
; D is good - if one knows P then one also believes P
; 5 is good - if one believes P then one knows that one believes P  - axioms 4 and 5 could be called 'introspection' axioms

; we already have axiom T in SUMO for knows, K and 4 are stated above

(=>
  (knows ?AGENT ?FORMULA)
  (truth ?FORMULA True))

; axiom D is already in SUMO for epistemic/doxastic

(=>
  (knows ?AGENT ?FORMULA)
  (believes ?AGENT ?FORMULA))

; axiom 5 for epistemic/doxastic

(=>
  (believes ?A ?P)
  (knows ?A
    (believes ?A ?P)))


; Deontic logic

; map obligatory to necessity and permitted to possibility
; N doesn't make sense if P is true that doesn't mean it's obligatory
; K seems true to me - it's obligatory that if you steal money you steal a small amount of money,
; implies that if you're obliged to steal money then you're obliged to steal a small amount of money.
; T is not true - if you ought to do P that doesn't mean P is true since people don't always do what they're supposed to
; 4 is questionable - if you ought to do P does that mean you ought to ought to do P ?  What does it even mean?
; B is problematic - if P is true then it ought to be permissible to P (if someone committed that doesn't mean that
; one ought to be permitted to commit murder
; D makes sense - if you ought to do P then you should be permitted to do P.  We have this in two forms in SUMO

(=>
  (confersNorm ?E ?F Obligation)
  (confersNorm ?E ?F Permission))

(=>
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Obligation)
  (modalAttribute ?FORMULA Permission))

; and a related axiom

(=>
  (deprivesNorm ?E ?F Permission)
  (deprivesNorm ?E ?F Obligation))

; we might therefore add

(=>
  (modalAttribute (not ?FORMULA) Permission)
  (modalAttribute (not ?FORMULA) Obligation))

; 5 seems a little problematic - if you have permission for P does that mean you're obliged to have permission?
; It may be dangerous to have obligation and permission without an authority - what does it really
; mean that P is permitted?  If there's no authority there can be no notion of permissibility just possibility.
; Permission and obligation as always with respect to an authority.  "He was permitted to do X (by authority Y)."
; Once relativized to an authority '5' makes a bit more sense but only if we have a hierarchy of authority -
; if entity X gives you permission to do Y then maybe some parent authority A should have obliged X to give you permission for Y
; but that all starts to sound rather contrived.


; ------------------------------------------

; First order translation could be using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_translation
; but the last two transformations don't hold for obligation and permission -
; if one is obliged to do something, that something isn't true in all worlds where
; one is obliged, since it's possible, for example, for people to break the law

; we have many things that condition worlds -
; possibility and necessity, but these are about the same thing possibility means there's at least one world
; in which something is true and necessity means its true in all worlds
; believes, knows each have their own world per knower or believer
