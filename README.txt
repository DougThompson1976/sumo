The main site for SUMO is https://www.ontologyportal.org

This directory contains knowledge base files written in SUO-KIF, and files in WordNet
data file format (see <https://wordnet.princeton.edu/documentation/wndb5wn>).

This directory also contains a subdirectory called "Translations" which contains the
natural language format files for languages other than English.

Files of knowledge that are new and immature belong in the "development" subdirectory.

There are many videos about SUMO at https://www.youtube.com/@adampease/ to help with learning how to use and extend SUMO.

Local installation of SigmaKEE and SUMOjEdit is recommended when developing extensions to SUMO.
